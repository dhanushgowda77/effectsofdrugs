                        <p>While growing up, most of the children may view drinking and smoking as privileges of adults and therefore consider it as cool activities to involve in. The importance of public awareness about the dangers of smoking and drinking has never been greater. The media has got a greater part in showing up the real side of these addictions.</p>
                        <h3>Smoking and its effects</h3>
                        <p>Cigarettes contain more than 4,000 chemical compounds and 400 toxic chemicals which include tar, carbon monoxide, DDT, arsenic and formaldehyde. The nicotine makes the cigarette highly addictive. Any quantity and kind of smoking is bad for your health, it is not only a risk factor for lung cancer, coronary artery disease, heart attack and stroke but also can cause damages to almost every organ in our body like leukaemia and various types of cancers. Smoking can damage the airways and air sacs of our lungs to cause chronic bronchitis and breathing difficulties which increases blood pressure and cholesterol levels. It may even lead to infertility, stillbirth and infant death syndrome.</p>
                      	<h3>Drinking and its effects</h3>
                        <p>Many people like to have drinks like beer, wine or some spirits. Light drinking or limited amount of drinking is tolerable and may even be beneficial for the heart. If the rate of consumption exceeds, it may lead to very serious medical problems.
						Some groups of people should not drink alcohol at all which include young people under the age of 18, pregnant women, people with health conditions, patients who are on medication, alcoholics who are recovering and people who drive or do activities that require action and coordination.

                        <p>Too much drinking can lead to many serious health conditions like acute intoxication, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision and impaired judgment. Along with this liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, pancreatitis, memory impairment may even occur.</p><hr>
                        <p>Both tobacco(cigarette) and alcohol affect the heart. While the harmful effect of smoking on the risk of cardiovascular disease is inevitable and the impact of drinking is more complex compared to smoking.<br>
                        It is significant to realise that quitting smoking can improve your quality of life â€“ physically, emotionally and financially. It can help you and the people around you breathe better and live longer.
						For people with heavy drinking habits, alcohol tolerance can lead to false reassurance that they are drinking within their limits, since they do not feel drunk. Some of the healthy benefits of reducing alcohol intake include weight loss, less anxiety, clearer skin and no hangovers.
